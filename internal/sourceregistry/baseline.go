// ValidateAgainstBaseline compares an earlier version of the registry with the
// current one and reports identifier reuse that the current file cannot show on
// its own.
//
// # WHY THE CURRENT-FILE VALIDATOR IS NOT ENOUGH
//
// docs/SOURCE_REGISTRY.md §2 says a source_id is "never reused, never
// renumbered". Validate enforces uniqueness WITHIN one file, and refuses an id
// listed in retired_source_ids. Neither of those sees history, and the bypass is
// ordinary rather than exotic:
//
//	commit N     src-0007 = "Provider A"
//	commit N+1   the record is deleted, and src-0007 is NOT retired
//	commit N+2   src-0007 = "Provider B"
//
// Every one of those files validates. Nothing in the third one knows that
// src-0007 ever meant something else, so anything that referenced src-0007 —
// an observation, a decision, an evaluation result — now points at a different
// provider with no diagnostic anywhere.
//
// This function closes that by comparing two versions: any id present in the
// baseline and absent from the current registry must appear in the current
// registry's retired_source_ids. Retirement becomes the required way to remove
// a record, and the rule becomes enforceable rather than merely stated.
//
// STATED LIMIT — and it matters. One call compares ONE pair of versions. That
// establishes non-reuse across that step and nothing more: it cannot see an id
// that was dropped and reused entirely within the range it did not examine. To
// make a claim about the whole history, every consecutive pair of versions of
// the file has to be checked, which is what scripts/registry-history-check.sh
// does by walking the file's revisions. The current-file validator alone proves
// nothing at all about history, and this function alone proves only one step of
// it.
