// FuzzAuthResponse drives the real client, over real TLS, against a server
// that answers the authentication request with arbitrary bytes.
//
// The invariant is the one that matters for an authentication client: no
// malformed, hostile or merely unexpected response may be interpreted as a
// successful authorisation. A decoder-level fuzz would not establish it —
// "the JSON parsed" and "we now believe we hold a valid session" are different
// claims, and the gap between them is where this kind of defect lives.
//
// The server is local. Nothing here contacts anything outside the machine.
