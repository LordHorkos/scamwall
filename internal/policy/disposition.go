// Disposition is what a plan does with one validated indicator.
//
// Three outcomes, not two. A binary propose/exclude forces every uncertain
// case into one of two wrong answers: propose it, and a suspicious-looking but
// possibly legitimate name gets blocked on a signal rather than on evidence;
// exclude it, and the fact that it was ever seen disappears from the report.
// Review keeps the entry visible without acting on it, which is the honest
// outcome when the input is a signal and the requirement is evidence.

	ReasonNotBlockAction Reason = "not_block_action"
	// ReasonBelowConfidence: the publisher did not state high confidence.
	ReasonBelowConfidence Reason = "below_confidence"
	// ReasonMixedScript: the name combines scripts in a way that is not a known
	// legitimate combination. This is a property of the NAME and says nothing
	// about whether the name is malicious, which is why it produces review
	// rather than a proposal or an exclusion.

// Decide assigns a disposition and a reason to one indicator.
//
// The order is deliberate and is the documented policy:
//
//  1. What the FEED asked for. An allow record is not a blocking candidate at
//     all, and a record the publisher is not confident about is not one either.
//     These are exclusions, because the feed itself has said so.
//  2. What the NAME looks like. A mixed-script name that the feed does assert
//     with high confidence is not excluded and not proposed: it goes to review.
//     Downgrading rather than excluding matters, because a signal is not
//     evidence and excluding on a signal silently withdraws protection from
//     entries the publisher was confident about.
//
// What this function will not do, in either direction:
//
//   - It will not treat Unicode, a non-Latin script, or punycode as evidence of
//     anything. Those signals exist, they are carried in the plan, and they
//     change no disposition. Most of the internationalised internet is
//     ordinary, and a policy that flagged it would be useless and unjust.
//   - It will not let a mixed-script name reach a proposal merely because the
//     old whole-feed rejection was removed. Removing a rejection without
//     putting the signal somewhere would make every such entry eligible, which
//     is the opposite half of the same defect.
